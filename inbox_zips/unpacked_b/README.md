# OpenClaw Enterprise v4 Agent Packs

This folder contains one directory per agent, each with:
- AGENTS.md (operating rules)
- SOUL.md (persona/voice/values)
- USER.md (user prefs + context)
- IDENTITY.md (name/emoji/handle)
- TOOLS.md (machine-local notes)
- HEARTBEAT.md (30-min checklist)
- BOOT.md (startup ritual)
- MEMORY.md (curated long-term memory)
- BOOTSTRAP.md (one-time onboarding)
- memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (daily working notes)

Adjust paths in TOOLS.md to match your NVMe mount when you deploy on the Raspberry Pi.
