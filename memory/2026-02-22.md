## 2026-02-22 09:59 Europe/Amsterdam — zeus
Facts:
- Robin confirmed expectation: 24/7 operation, durable memory, recoverability of decisions/ideas across weeks.
- Captured 7 Telegram group chat IDs from live inbound pings.

Decisions:
- Remove active-hours heartbeat constraints to allow 24/7 operation.
- Enforce persistent memory via hourly log + nightly rollup cron jobs.

Ideas:
- Add strict Telegram channel registry with ID->name->routing purpose to prevent context loss.

Artifacts:
- /home/rubiorobin/.openclaw/workspace/ops/TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_REGISTRY.md
- /home/rubiorobin/.openclaw/workspace/memory/README.md
- /home/rubiorobin/.openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md
- Cron jobs: zeus-memory-hourly, zeus-memory-rollup-2355

Open actions:
- [Zeus] Map each captured group ID to exact channel name (deadline: vandaag)
- [Zeus] Attach routing policy per group for auto-updates (deadline: vandaag)

## 2026-02-22 10:31 Europe/Amsterdam — zeus
Facts:
- Robin requested full re-activation: resume channel-based execution, use Telegram history as operating baseline, and keep making from 08:00 to 20:00.
- Telegram channel routing is already mapped for 7 groups and stable.

Decisions:
- Operating window set to 08:00–20:00 Europe/Amsterdam across all agents.
- Heartbeat cadence tightened to every 30m for all agents within that window.

Ideas:
- Keep a daily “channel obligations checklist” so each lane knows mandatory updates and deliverables.

Artifacts:
- Config updated: /home/rubiorobin/.openclaw/openclaw.json
- Registry: /home/rubiorobin/.openclaw/workspace/ops/TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_REGISTRY.md

Open actions:
- [Zeus] Trigger lane kickoff status in all operational channels now (deadline: immediate)
- [Zeus] Keep memory logging hourly + EOD rollup active (deadline: continuous)

## 2026-02-22 10:45 Europe/Amsterdam — zeus-memory-hourly
Facts:
- Hourly memory persistence cron executed successfully at 10:45 Europe/Amsterdam.
- Daily memory log already contains 09:59 and 10:31 operational checkpoints.

Decisions:
- Continue concise hourly append format with fixed sections (Facts, Decisions, Ideas, Artifacts, Open actions).

Ideas:
- Reusable pattern: each hourly entry should reference only net-new facts/changes to avoid duplication and keep rollups clean.

Artifacts:
- Updated: /home/rubiorobin/.openclaw/workspace/memory/2026-02-22.md

Open actions:
- [Zeus] Append next hourly checkpoint at 11:45 Europe/Amsterdam (deadline: next hour)

## 2026-02-22 11:45 Europe/Amsterdam — zeus-memory-hourly
Facts:
- Hourly memory persistence cron executed successfully at 11:45 Europe/Amsterdam.
- No new operational decisions or channel-routing changes were recorded since the 10:45 checkpoint.

Decisions:
- Keep hourly entries minimal when state is unchanged, while preserving timestamp continuity for auditability.

Ideas:
- Reusable pattern: on no-change hours, log explicit “no change” deltas to distinguish stability from missing updates.

Artifacts:
- Updated: /home/rubiorobin/.openclaw/workspace/memory/2026-02-22.md

Open actions:
- [Zeus] Append next hourly checkpoint at 12:45 Europe/Amsterdam (deadline: next hour)

## 2026-02-22 11:50 Europe/Amsterdam — zeus
Facts:
- Trello API bereikbaar; board/koppeling werkt.
- Card `[AGENT] main` (`6999c76971022dcdf764a7e4`) had geen owner (`idMembers=[]`).

Decisions:
- Owner assignment hersteld door Robin member-id toe te wijzen (`6998a74bb0842aae11393b23`).

Ideas:
- Voeg periodieke auto-check toe: detecteer `agent` cards zonder owner en herstel/escalate direct.

Artifacts:
- Trello card: `6999c76971022dcdf764a7e4`
- Trello comment: `699adfd7d21078953dfcd790`
- Memory log: `memory/2026-02-22.md`

Open actions:
- [Zeus] uitbreiden naar alle [AGENT]-cards (owner-check + auto-comment) (deadline: vandaag)
