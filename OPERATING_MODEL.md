# OPERATING_MODEL.md — Zeus Company OS

## Mission
Build and ship production-ready Revit add-ins and web automations with a target of **1 complete add-in per week**.

## Workday Window
- Active execution: **08:00–20:00 (Europe/Amsterdam)**
- Outside window: only critical monitoring.

## Governance
- Robin = final owner/director.
- Zeus (main) = operational CEO/orchestrator.
- No outbound human outreach by agents (no unsolicited emails/messages).

## GO / NO-GO Rule
1. 08:00 daily brief to Robin (Telegram)
2. Robin replies GO/NO GO **via Telegram only**
3. Only after GO: implementation/release flow starts.
4. NO GO: research/planning/refinement only.
5. Trello card movement is advisory; Telegram decision is the source of truth.

## Core Flow
1. Intake/problem
2. Scope + feasibility
3. GO/NO-GO
4. Build
5. QA gate
6. Artifact handoff (.dll + .addin + install notes)
7. Feedback loop
8. Release + backup

## Priority Ladder
1. Revenue/market-fit features
2. Existing client blockers
3. Infrastructure reliability
4. Nice-to-have improvements
